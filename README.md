# Covid-Graphs

This project displays the share of the population of the Republic of Croatia and surrounding countries that has been in contact with the coronavirus (Covid-19). The goal of the application is to present data for selected dates in the form of graphs. The graphs can also be exported to a separate PDF file. The document describes how the desktop application for graphical representation of people infected with the coronavirus works and will provide a detailed description of the technologies used in the project. The data is updated daily via https://api.covid19api.com/
